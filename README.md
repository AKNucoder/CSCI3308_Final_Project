##Description
Carpooling Connections:

A website that provides a database of users looking to either carpool people in their car or provides a list of people who are looking to carpool. Users that are looking to provide a carpooling service, select where they are going, how many people they can drive, and how much they are charging. After the Driver posts they get a list of matches that helps them select users interested in the route faster. Users that are looking to hitch a ride select where they would like to go, and they are provided a list of options.
People searching for a ride will be able to filter by beginning, end and time.

##Vision Statement
To provide a carpooling service to all people and lead the way towards reducing fuel emissions and fostering collaboration while we broaden community benefit.

##Motivation

Motivation
Often when there are big events, there are typically people near that are going to be attending an event that you are going to too, whether that be work or a social activity. Our motivation is to be able to connect people nearby so that they can arrange carpools and ultimately more efficient ways to get more people to the same place. As a result we will be able to cut down on emissions, reduce traffic congestion to and from events and establish a community of people nearby who have similar interests. 

##Risks
-Version control getting out of hand and the code base being changed by too many people at once.
-A specific feature takes too long to learn and implement and ends up being only half-finished.
-Uncaught bugs impede the usage of the website.
-Too many dependencies within the code result in breaking the entire website if one part doesn’t work.

##Risk Mitigation Plan
-Ensure that each member is aware of what portion of the code they are responsible for and that they don’t work on code that another user might be working on.
-Have clear rules for branching and merging into the main code base so that broken code doesn’t get into the main files.
-Reduce the amount of dependencies in the code and ensure that steps are taken to try and make the program more modular, that is one area of the code does not depend highly on the other in order to work.

##Version Control
We will use GitHub for Version Control, pushing with tags every time to keep Version Control in check .

##Software Development Methodology
Agile

We will have people working on different aspects of the project but always collaborating with each other to make sure the progress is going in the right direction. 

##Collaboration Tool
We are using Slack as a collaboration tool
